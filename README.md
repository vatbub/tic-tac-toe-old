# Tic Tac Toe
TicTacToe is a Java based Tic Tac Toe game (see 
[here](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-Tac-Toe) for the rules)<br>

It was done as an exercise by Frederik Kammel. 

A newer, fancier version with a perfect AI and online multiplayer can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/vatbub/tictactoe).

## Download
To be able to play this game, you need to download the FOKLauncher ([Binary](https://bintray.com/vatbub/fokprojectsReleases/foklauncher#downloads) | [GitHub repo](https://github.com/vatbub/foklauncher))

## Build
### Prerequisites
1. `git`(obvously ;) )
2. JDK 8
3. `maven`

Once you have git and maven installed, clone the repo and run `mvn clean package`. You should now find the executable jar file in the `target` folder.
